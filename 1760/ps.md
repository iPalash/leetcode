Input: nums = [2,4,8,2], maxOperations = 4
Output: 2
Explanation:
- Divide the bag with 8 balls into two bags of sizes 4 and 4. [2,4,8,2] -> [2,4,4,4,2].
- Divide the bag with 4 balls into two bags of sizes 2 and 2. [2,4,4,4,2] -> [2,2,2,4,4,2].
- Divide the bag with 4 balls into two bags of sizes 2 and 2. [2,2,2,4,4,2] -> [2,2,2,2,2,4,2].
- Divide the bag with 4 balls into two bags of sizes 2 and 2. [2,2,2,2,2,4,2] -> [2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2].
The bag with the most number of balls has 2 balls, so your penalty is 2 an you should return 2.


Idea:
When k steps are remaining, pick the largest element and divide it into (k+1)th parts. 
Say largest is 21 and k=3
Then first break is 21//(3+1) = 5
So, split at kth step is 5,16
continue until all is one or k becomes zero
