## Example

Input: target = 7, nums = [2,3,1,2,4,3]
Output: 2
Explanation: The subarray [4,3] has the minimal length under the problem constraint.

## Constraints

- Try finding in linear time

## Idea

- Got an idea for o(nlogn) earlier, try impl later !TODO
- Figured out the linear time solution of sliding windows with two pointers
